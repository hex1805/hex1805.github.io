                    the structure of tags and elements such as divs or sections. 
                    Can be used as a good exercise when studying other websites, 
                    deciding how elements could be classified. </div>

                    but I found it really beneficial to get some especially unique ideas.
                    Most importantly to get out a few bad ideas, for every decent idea.
                    It makes each option easier to commit to because it doesn't matter
                    if you don't like it. It's also helpful to compare different ideas.
                    One idea may be really unique, but you may prefer a different idea in
                    contrast. The idea of connected bubbles came from this exercise.</div>

                    I find in coding websites is making pages responsive to different 
                    devices and viewing ratios. This exercise is a good reminder to also 
                    code sites to be easily viewable from different devices. Although I'm 
                    not too sure how to recognise how the site is being viewed, it was 
                    good to pre-plan how I'd want my elements set out for when I do code 
                    for this.
